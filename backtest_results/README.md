# Backtest Results Folder

## Purpose

This folder stores **backtest results and performance reports** generated by Lumibot's backtesting engine. These results are used to evaluate strategy performance, compare different risk profiles, and make decisions about strategy deployment.

## Overview

When you run backtests using Lumibot strategies from the `strategies/` folder, the results are saved here. These results include:
- Performance metrics (returns, Sharpe ratio, max drawdown, etc.)
- Trade history and execution logs
- Portfolio value over time
- Risk metrics and statistics
- Visualizations and charts (if generated)

## Contents

This folder may contain:
- **CSV files**: Trade logs, performance metrics, portfolio history
- **JSON files**: Configuration snapshots, strategy parameters
- **HTML reports**: Interactive backtest reports (if generated by Lumibot)
- **Charts/Images**: Performance visualizations, equity curves
- **Log files**: Detailed execution logs from backtesting runs

## File Naming Convention

It is recommended to use descriptive naming for backtest results:
- Include strategy name (e.g., `conservative`, `aggressive`)
- Include date range (e.g., `2020-2024`)
- Include timestamp or version identifier

Example: `conservative_strategy_2020-2024_20240115.json`

## Usage

### Running Backtests

Backtests are typically run using Lumibot's backtesting functionality:

```python
from lumibot.backtesting import YahooDataBacktesting
from strategies.your_strategy import YourStrategy

# Configure backtest parameters
backtesting_start = datetime(2020, 1, 1)
backtesting_end = datetime(2024, 1, 1)

# Run backtest
stats = strategy.backtest(
    YahooDataBacktesting,
    backtesting_start,
    backtesting_end,
    benchmark_asset="SPY"
)

# Results will be saved to this folder
```

### Analyzing Results

Use the results in this folder to:
1. **Compare Strategies**: Evaluate performance across different risk profiles
2. **Optimize Parameters**: Identify best-performing parameter combinations
3. **Risk Assessment**: Analyze drawdowns, volatility, and risk-adjusted returns
4. **Decision Making**: Determine which strategies are ready for live deployment

## Key Metrics to Review

When analyzing backtest results, pay attention to:
- **Total Return**: Overall performance over the backtest period
- **Sharpe Ratio**: Risk-adjusted return metric
- **Maximum Drawdown**: Largest peak-to-trough decline
- **Win Rate**: Percentage of profitable trades
- **Average Win/Loss**: Ratio of average winning to losing trades
- **Volatility**: Standard deviation of returns
- **Beta**: Correlation with market (SPY)

## Best Practices

1. **Version Control**: Keep historical backtest results for comparison
2. **Documentation**: Include notes about strategy parameters and market conditions
3. **Regular Updates**: Run new backtests as strategies evolve
4. **Validation**: Compare backtest results with live trading performance
5. **Storage**: Archive old results but keep recent ones easily accessible

## Notes

- Backtest results are historical and may not predict future performance
- Results should be validated against out-of-sample data before live deployment
- Market conditions during backtesting may differ from current conditions
- Transaction costs and slippage should be considered when interpreting results
- Results from different time periods may not be directly comparable

## Integration with Strategies

This folder works in conjunction with:
- **`strategies/`**: Source of the strategies being backtested
- **`data/STOCKS/`**: Historical data used for backtesting
- **Main project**: Results inform strategy development and deployment decisions
